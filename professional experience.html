	   <h1> My background </h1>
	   
	   <p>
	   I have spent a large part of my adult life in education. First, I started out as a education student and earned by B.S. in education from EKU. 
	   While I was a student, I worked with small children in a pre-school setting. After graduation, I woked almost 9 years as a middle school science teacher. 
	   During that time I helped students build their science knowledge and their critical thinking skills.  You can view examples of their work below. </p>

	   Although I loved my content area and I loved teaching, I wanted to take time to explore some other options in education. So, after that, I 
	   transitioned into higher education. I currently work as an academic advisor, so I am still involved in education, and I have used my science skills
	   to help other people interested in the field of science, <strong> particularly STEM studies and healthcare.</strong> While on this break from K-12 education, I began 
	   to research other types of positions in K12 that I might be interested in.  The one that seemed to fit me the best was library media specialist. So, I <i> returned
	   to <A href="https://www.eku.edu/"> EKU </A> to obtain my second masters degree and my Rank 1.</i> </p>
