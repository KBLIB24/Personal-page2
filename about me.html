	<h1> About me </h1>
	
	
	<p> Apart from being interested in education I have several hobbies and interests. <br> </br>
I love spending time with my husband and our 2 cats, Gracie and Mia. My cats are sisters and are about 2 years old. 
My husband and I enjoy spending time together at home or going to to events and travelling. I also truly enjoy wildlife and animals. <br> </br> </p>

  Although there are many places I want to visit, my favorite vacation spot is the beach, especially the Myrtle beach area in South Carolina. This area includes not only Myrtle Beach, but other smaller beaches like Surfside, Garden City and even Huntington Beach state park, which is where I was married. A map of the area is below to help you visualize the area.

<p> I also enjoy being outside. Some of my favorite activities include hiking, playing tennis and swimming. 
Some other  favorites of mine are playing games (board games, arcade games and video games), going to the movies and listening to music.
