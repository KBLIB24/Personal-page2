	<p> Since I truly enjoyed teaching and I have a good skill set for research and information literacy I thought this would be a good area of study for me. <br> </br>

I also am a big believer in literacy skills and love to read and enjoy sharing reading and stories with others.
It also seems like an area I can have more freedom and collaboration with others within the school. <br> </br>
<br> </br>

As part of my degree program, I have been able to learn more about technology and apply that to my current job and explore topics such as diversity in literature, 
children and adolescent literature and skills to effectively teach this knowledge to others.<br> </br>

I am very much looking forward to when I am working as a school media specialist and  I have a few recommendations for some chilling YA reading options to beat the Summer heat. 
<br></br>
1.For a quick, fun reading experience, check out the graphic novel " Dead Weight: Murder at Camp Bloom".  A group of adolescent campers try to solve the mystery of the murder of one
their counselors. Check out the book trailer!

2. For a darker, gritty read check out "Sadie".  This story follows a young girl as she tried to solve the murder of her sister.  Her search takes her to some seedy places that no young girl should venture to. How will Sadie's journey end?

3. If you need a spine chiller this Summer, check out "Alone".  This book will take you into the world of estraged family members living in solitude in a mansion high on a mountain when some uninvited guests show up and suddenly mysterious things begin to happen and a murderer must be found.
