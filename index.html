	   <p> Hi! My name is Kristy Bowman. This is my personal website, feel free
	   to look around and explore. I am a first-generation college graduate of my family
	   and like many others, getting here was not easy. I love to learn and education 
	   is my academic and career field, but I also have a lot of interests 
	   and hobbies. Please look through my site to get to know me a little better, 
	   both on a professional and personal level. </p>
	
	   <p> <em>Education is a wonderful field of work and study. </em> <br> </br> <b> You can help shape lives and teach people critical skills they need to thrive in life. </b>
